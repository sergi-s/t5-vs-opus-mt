## Introduction

This project aims to compare the performance of two popular translation models: `t5-small` and `Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr`. The comparison is based on their ability to translate text from English to French using the WMT14 dataset. The results are evaluated to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this comparison is the WMT14 English-to-French dataset, which is a standard benchmark for machine translation tasks.

## Models

### T5-Small

[T5-Small](https://huggingface.co/t5-small) is a smaller version of the T5 model, which was introduced by Google Research. It is designed to handle a variety of NLP tasks, including translation, by framing them as text-to-text transformations.

### Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr

[Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr](https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr) is a translation model provided by the OPUS-MT project. It is specifically trained for translating text from English to French.
